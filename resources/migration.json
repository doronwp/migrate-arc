It may not offer customer service in the usual sense, but it will enable you to reach a live person in a worst-case scenario, which would be the loss of your\r\ncard.\r\n<h2><a id=\"heading9\"><\/a>nbkc Checking Pros and Cons<\/h2>\r\n<div class=\"callout success\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Pros:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>$0 initial deposit:<\/strong> This and the absence of a minimum balance requirement, make the checking and money market accounts perfect for new and small depositors.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Earn interest:<\/strong>\u00c2\u00a00.80% on all account checking balances balances and even higher rates on the Money Market account.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>No monthly service fees:<\/strong>\u00c2\u00a0On either the checking or money market accounts.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>No-fee extras:<\/strong> No fees for a box of checks, online banking with bill pay, overdrafts and NSFs, stop payments and incoming domestic wires.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Free ATMs:<\/strong> Access more than 34,000 fee-free in-network ATMs nationwide.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Business banking services:<\/strong> Full service banking plus business credit cards.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Loan options:<\/strong> Home, auto and various personal loans.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"callout alert\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Cons:<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>No local bank branches:<\/strong>\u00c2\u00a0Other than four in the Kansas City area.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Limited customer service: <\/strong>Only available during regular business hours (8am CT - 5pm CT), which could be a limiting factor with a checking account.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>No personal credit card:\u00c2\u00a0<\/strong>nbkc only offers business credit cards.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>International wire fees:\u00c2\u00a0<\/strong>Industry Standard at $45 but there are\u00c2\u00a0 like Discover Bank and Citizens Bank that offer them for less<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<h2><a id=\"heading10\"><\/a>Should You Open an nbkc Bank Account?<\/h2>\r\nnbkc is a small, locally run bank that operates nationwide. But they have one advantage over most other online banks, and that's that they provide the full range of banking services. That includes checking and savings accounts, as well as CDs and IRAs. But they also provide the full selection of business services, as well as all types of personal loans.\r\n\r\nThe nbkc Everything Account is at the very center of nbkc Bank product offerings. Not only does it pay interest of 0.80%, but it also provides paper checks, which is becoming increasingly uncommon among online banks. As well, there are no regular fees associated with this account. That gives you a pure benefit on the interest rate, without it being reduced by a large number of fees.\r\n\r\nThe Money Market account is now one of the highest paying savings or money market accounts available among online banks and requires a minimum balance of nothing to get started.\r\n\r\nHowever, perhaps to offset that high minimum balance CD, nbkc offers it's Add-to Starter CD. This certificate can be opened with as little as $25, and pays an interest rate of 0.80% on a one year term.\r\n\r\nAnd if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re self-employed, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotta love an online bank that offers full business services, in addition to high interest checking and CDs. You can open a business checking account with no transaction fees, and no limits. But that's just the beginning, since they also provide business loans and treasury solutions, including cash management and merchant services.\r\n\r\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like more information, or if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to open an account, visit the <a rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" href=\"http:\/\/dev.local.com\/links\/nbkc-bank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nbkc Everything Account website<\/a>.\r\n\r\n[wcms_brand_fields brandid=\"61769\" selling_pt_3]"
